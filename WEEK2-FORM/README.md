# Week 2 Single-Page Form

## 1) Purpose of This Form
This is a single-page form that was built for a Week 2 assignment.
The intended purpose of this form is to demonstrate a sign up for a new user account (Note: not a real sign up).

## 2) List of Inputs and Alidation Rules
This form uses three input/alidation rules for the sign up, which includes:

- `Name` — required, minimum 2 characters
- `Email` — required, must be valid email
- `Password` — required, minimum 8 characters

## 3) How Feedback is Presented (Where Do Errors/Success Appear?)
Errors appear below each field with specific instructions.
A success message appears below the submit button.
Invalid fields are highlighted and announced to screen readers.

## 4) L One DevTools Insight I used (Console/Elements/Styles)
I used the `[Console]` to check `field values` and the `[Elements]` to confirm `labels` were correctly connected to `inputs`.
