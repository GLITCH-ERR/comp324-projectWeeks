## 1) Flex pattern

For the flex pattern, I used flexbox for the navigation bar (.site-nav) with gap and wrapping so links adjust on small screens.

## 2) Grid pattern

For the grid pattern, I used CSS Grid for the card list (.card-grid) with auto-fit and minmax to create a responsive gallery.

## 3) Responsive behavior

Finally, for the responsive behavior, I added a 900px breakpoint where the layout changes from stacked to a two-column list + detail layout.
