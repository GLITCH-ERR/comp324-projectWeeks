# COMP 324 - Project Weeks

## Purpose

This project is multiple, single-page websites I built for a COMP 324 to practice web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Details

The different folders should contain their own README.md-ses that hold their own information of the different HTMLs.
